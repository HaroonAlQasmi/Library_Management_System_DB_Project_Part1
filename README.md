-What part was the most difficult?
Drawing the ERD even though I know that it is correct theoretically I feel it needs a bit on an artistic nature to complete superbly 

-Which SQL command (DDL, DML, DQL) did you learn the most from? 
I would have to say DQL because I feel it is what I will be using the most in the future and even though all of them are easy they are still insufferable but the least one I hate and feel I will use in the future is the DQL

-What did you discover from your error logs that made you think like a real developer?
Usually error messages have a key word that would immediatly let you what might be wrong for example like telling you the "Example" table can't be found so you would know that it wasn"t created or it was deleted or maybe you just misspeled
